About:

This program simply adds a new page to the backs of scanforms for written and essay questions. It is primarily made with ZipGrade in mind. Other services, such as Akindi, are untested, but it should work.

Adding multiple pages is untested. Do so AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

Installation:

Download the .exe here and save it to your desktop:

https://github.com/CalebHendren/AppendAnswerSheet/blob/master/dist/ZipGradeWritten.exe

Usage:

Run the .exe program

Select your SheetPack in the Sheet Pack field.

Select your written answer sheet in the Written Answer Sheet field.

Hit the Process PDF button

A new PDF will be created with the revised SheetPacks.
